Problem:
1.	Design a Multiplier which can multiply two numbers. The numbers will be read from the ROM and the result will be written in the RAM. A control unit will control data reading, multiplying and the writing stages. Write a Verilog code and testbench for your above design.
Hints: Use your previously designed ROM, RAM, and the combinational multiplier.
